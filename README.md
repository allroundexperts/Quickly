## What is Quickly?
**Quickly is a free, open-source cold email platform designed to be extremely simple and purpose-built for cold outreach.** It gives sales teams, agencies, and indie hackers the same multi-inbox sequencing, AI reply classification, and campaign analytics you expect from Instantly — but self-hosted on your own infrastructure.

Emails are sent through **Google and Microsoft’s official APIs using OAuth 2.0**, meaning your campaigns use **Gmail and Microsoft 365's own sending infrastructure and IP reputation** rather than shared SMTP servers. The result is deliverability that matches — and often exceeds — traditional SaaS cold email tools.

Quickly focuses on doing **cold email extremely well**, without unnecessary complexity. If you've used Instantly before, you'll feel immediately at home.

```bash
# Get up and running in under 5 minutes
docker compose up -d
```

If this saves you money, please consider dropping a ⭐ — it helps others find the project.

## Why Quickly? (vs. Instantly)

| What you're paying for today             | What Quickly gives you instead                         |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| $97–$500/month in SaaS fees              | Deploy free on Railway or any Linux VPS                |
| Per-seat pricing that scales against you | Unlimited team members, unlimited contacts             |
| Your lead data on vendor servers         | 100% self-hosted — your server, your Postgres database |
| Vendor lock-in and feature gating        | MIT licensed, fully hackable, 90+ REST API endpoints   |
| Complex multi-tool onboarding            | One `docker compose up` — live in under 5 minutes      |

> **Quickly is an open-source clone of Instantly.** Looking for Instantly, Smartlead, or Lemlist alternatives for cold email? Quickly gives you the same multi-inbox sequencing, AI reply classification, and campaign analytics — self-hosted, no monthly fees, your data on your server.

## Features

### Core Sending

* **Multi-step email sequences** — Unlimited follow-up steps, configurable wait days, automatic reply threading, HTML or plain-text bodies
* **Smart inbox rotation** — Spread sends across unlimited Gmail and Microsoft 365 inboxes, with per-inbox daily limits respected automatically
* **OAuth2 sending via Gmail & Microsoft 365** — Emails are sent using Google and Microsoft’s official APIs, leveraging their trusted infrastructure and IP reputation instead of shared SMTP servers
* **Warm-up scheduling** — Built-in ramp-up and configurable send-time jitter to protect deliverability
* **Bounce detection** — Permanent failures are caught automatically; affected leads are stopped to protect sender reputation

### Personalization & Testing

* **Template variables** — Use `{{name}}`, `{{company}}`, `{{title}}`, or any custom field from your CSV in subject lines and email bodies
* **A/B testing** — Multiple subject/body variants per step; Quickly tracks open rates, click rates, and reply rates per variant and selects randomly at send time
* **CSV import** — Any CSV column beyond `email` automatically becomes a template variable

### Inbox & Replies

* **Unified inbox (Unibox)** — Real-time reply detection across all connected Gmail and Microsoft 365 accounts, with threaded view and compose/reply
* **AI reply classification** — Automatically classifies every reply as `interested`, `not_interested`, `out_of_office`, `wrong_person`, `auto_reply`, or `unsubscribed`. Supports 19 AI providers including **Ollama** for fully offline, on-premise classification
* **Lead provider matching** — DNS lookup routes sends through inboxes that match the lead's email provider

### Tracking & Analytics

* **Open & click tracking** — Pixel tracking and link wrapping; **Quickly Beacon** for custom tracking hostnames on prebuilt / Docker deployments (legacy CNAME-to-Quickly optional for advanced host-Caddy setups)
* **Full analytics** — Per-campaign stats, per-step performance, open/click/reply rates, and timeline charts
* **System health dashboard** — Live status for inbox token health, tracking domain reachability, and AI provider connectivity

### Developer & Automation

* **Webhooks** — 15 real-time event types: `email.sent`, `email.opened`, `email.clicked`, `email.bounced`, `lead.replied`, `lead.interested`, `lead.unsubscribed`, `lead.status_changed`, and more
* **REST API** — 90+ endpoints secured by JWT auth and API keys. Custom n8n node included
* **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** — Remote Streamable HTTP server at `/api/mcp` for leads tools; connect with `mcp-remote` from Cursor or other clients ([docs/MCP.md](docs/MCP.md))
* **Email verification** — Verify lead addresses before sending via any HTTP provider
* **Test mode** — Simulate sends, opens, and clicks without delivering real emails
* **Priority scheduling** — Drag campaigns to set priority; choose priority-first or round-robin strategies

## Quick Start

### Option A: Deploy on Railway (Fastest — no server needed)

> Up and running in under 5 minutes with automatic HTTPS. Railway has a free tier.

1. Create a new project on [Railway](https://railway.com) → **Deploy a Docker image** → `azowail/quickly:latest`
2. Add a **PostgreSQL** database plugin — Railway injects `DATABASE_URL` automatically
3. Set your environment variables (see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) below)
4. Deploy — Railway provides a public HTTPS URL automatically

→ [Full Railway walkthrough](docs/INSTALL.md#option-a-railway--paas-no-server-needed)

---

### Option B: Self-host on a VPS (Docker Compose)

```bash
docker volume create quickly_pgdata   # Postgres data — do once before first start

mkdir quickly && cd quickly
curl -LO https://github.com/AbdelftahZowail/Quickly/releases/latest/download/docker-compose.yml
curl -LO https://github.com/AbdelftahZowail/Quickly/releases/latest/download/Caddyfile
curl -LO https://github.com/AbdelftahZowail/Quickly/releases/latest/download/.env.example
mv .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and set at minimum:

```env
CADDY_HOST=yourdomain.com
BASE_URL=https://yourdomain.com
QUICKLY_SECRET_KEY=<run: python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(64))">
```

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Caddy automatically provisions and renews a Let's Encrypt TLS certificate. Open `https://yourdomain.com` — Quickly is live.

**Already running Caddy on the server?** Download `docker-compose-not-host.yml` from the same release instead, start with `docker compose -f docker-compose-not-host.yml up -d`, and add `reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:5050` for your domain in the host Caddyfile. That path is for operators who want **one** app behind host Caddy with on-demand TLS for tracking domains; it is **not** the default recommendation — prefer [**Quickly Beacon**](docs/INSTALL.md#quickly-beacon-recommended-custom-tracking-hostnames) for `track.yourdomain.com`–style links.

---

### Option C: Local Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AbdelftahZowail/Quickly.git
cd quickly

python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
# .venv\Scripts\activate    # Windows

pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env: set BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000

uvicorn app.main:app --reload    # API at http://localhost:8000

# In a separate terminal:
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev   # UI at http://localhost:5173
```

→ [Full local dev guide including Docker dev stack](docs/INSTALL.md#option-d-local-development)

---

## First Login

On first deploy, visit your Quickly URL — a registration form appears to create the initial admin account. **Registration closes after the first account is created.** Additional users must be invited by an admin from the Settings page.

---

## Connecting Inboxes

Quickly supports Gmail (via Google OAuth), Microsoft 365 / Outlook (via Azure OAuth), and any SMTP relay (Amazon SES, Brevo, self-hosted, …) with optional IMAP reply sync. All three inbox types can be mixed freely in the same campaign.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Is Quickly really free?**
Yes. Quickly is MIT licensed. You pay nothing to Quickly — your only cost is the server you host it on (or Railway's free tier).

**How does Quickly compare to Instantly?**
Quickly covers Instantly's core features: multi-step sequences, inbox rotation, A/B testing, AI reply classification, open/click tracking, and a unified inbox. The difference is ownership — your data stays on your server, and there are no monthly fees or seat limits. Looking for Instantly, Smartlead, or Lemlist alternatives? If your focus is cold email outreach, Quickly delivers the same experience without the SaaS price tag.

**Does Quickly support Microsoft 365 / Outlook?**
Yes. Quickly connects to Gmail via Google OAuth, to Microsoft 365, Office 365, and personal Outlook.com accounts via Microsoft Graph, and to any SMTP relay (Amazon SES, Brevo, self-hosted, …) with optional IMAP reply sync. All inbox types can be mixed in the same campaign.

**Can I use Quickly without a custom domain?**
Yes. You can deploy on Railway and use the generated subdomain, or run Quickly over plain HTTP without `CADDY_HOST` set.

**Does AI reply classification require an OpenAI key?**
No. Quickly supports 19 AI providers including Anthropic, Google Gemini, Mistral, Groq, Cohere, and Ollama — which lets you run classification fully locally with no external API calls.
